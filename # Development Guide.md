# Development Guide for Tempo Labs

## Project Overview

AA-05 is an AI agent integration platform that combines multiple open-source AI frameworks into a unified system for automated coding, debugging, and software development.

## Current Architecture

The platform uses a modular architecture with these key components:

1. `AAIntegration`: The core integration class that initializes and manages all components
2. Component-specific adaptors: Bridge between the central system and individual repositories
3. Agent orchestration: Manages collaboration between different agent types
4. Memory system: Provides context and knowledge sharing across sessions

## Priority Development Areas

### 1. Memory Integration with mem0

The platform needs robust memory management to maintain context across development sessions. The mem0 component (https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0-chrome-extension) is critical for this functionality.

**Requested Developments:**

- Create a memory module that integrates with mem0's storage capabilities
- Implement context persistence for development projects
- Design a memory retrieval system optimized for code-related knowledge
- Ensure memory entries are properly indexed and searchable

### 2. Agent Orchestration

We need a sophisticated orchestration system to coordinate multiple agent types.

**Requested Developments:**

- Design a workflow system that allows agents to collaborate on complex tasks
- Implement a task decomposition module that breaks problems into appropriate subtasks
- Create a coordination protocol for agent communication

### 3. Code Generation Enhancement

The platform should be capable of advanced code generation and optimization.

**Requested Developments:**

- Implement specialized code generation agents that leverage DeepSeek and other models
- Create a code quality assessment system
- Design an iterative improvement process for generated code

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.10+ compatibility
- Support for both API-based and local language models
- Clean, well-documented code with type hints
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Detailed documentation for each module
