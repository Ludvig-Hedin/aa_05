# AA-05: AI Agent Integration Platform

This project integrates multiple AI agent frameworks into a unified platform capable of automated coding, debugging, and deployment. It leverages several open-source AI agent repositories to create a comprehensive development automation system.

## Repository Structure

- `/components`: Contains all integrated repositories as Git submodules
- `/aa_integration`: Core integration code that connects all components
- `/app`: Web application for interacting with the platform
- `/scripts`: Utility scripts for installation and management

## Integration Goals

1. **Unified API**: Provide a single interface to access all agent capabilities
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Allow agents to collaborate on complex tasks
3. **Code Generation**: Generate, improve, and debug code automatically
4. **Model Flexibility**: Support various language models (OpenAI, local models, etc.)
5. **Extensibility**: Make it easy to add new agent types and tools

## Technical Architecture

The system uses a modular approach with these key components:

1. **AutoGPT**: Provides autonomous agent capabilities
2. **LangChain**: Handles LLM interactions and chains
3. **Supabase**: Database and authentication
4. **n8n**: Workflow automation
5. **llama-cpp-python**: Local model integration
6. **Various specialized agents**: For research, job applications, etc.

## Getting Started

See the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Project Goals

1. Create a unified system for AI-driven software development
2. Automatically generate, debug, and optimize code
3. Provide memory persistence across development sessions
4. Enable seamless collaboration between different agent types

## System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)

The system uses a modular architecture with these key layers:

1. **Core Integration Layer**: Connects and orchestrates all components
2. **Agent Layer**: Provides specialized agents for different tasks
3. **Memory Layer**: Maintains context and knowledge across sessions
4. **Execution Layer**: Handles code generation and execution
5. **Tool Layer**: Integrates external tools and APIs

## Getting Started

See the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for setup instructions.

## Development Roadmap

Current development focus:
- Memory integration with mem0
- Enhanced code generation capabilities
- Workflow automation with n8n
